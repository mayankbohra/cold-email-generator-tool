The wind is strongly blowing in favor of electronic payments - India wants to buy/order everything online, go cashless (regulation) and can’t have enough of using smartphones! Startups and internet businesses currently see a payment’ success rate of 60% ( 40 out of 100 people fail during the payments process!). These businesses that will define our future are absolutely dependent on solving digital payments. Big industry with bigger problems to solve!\n",
      "How can Engineering solve this?\n",
      "Payments is a complex ecosystem involving banks, RBI regulations, payment networks, telecom infrastructure, online and offline merchants. There is no way to align all these stars without radical engineering innovation. Talk to us about it.\n",

      "You get the opportunity to work in a free liberal environment with some of the best engineers and entrepreneurs. We live & breathe the art of building amazing products with impeccable engineering. We have heavily invested on new methods of engineering using Functional Programming/FRP, Haskell/Purescript and Scalable Data Systems. We want more innovators and a little bit of madness to take it further. For us office is like home with everything needed to make us comfortably code all day and chill out too. We have a full size piano, drums and a Shruti box if you are into music :) Lots of books, pictionary and interesting people to talk to about varied subjects - art, philosophy and of course about how to do the highest feats of engineering/design.
